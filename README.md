# Hi, I'm Vinícius 👋
### Student
Currently in the last year of highschool, I have been learning programming for the last couple of years, 
and in the process delved into Python, Ruby, Javascript, Elixir, and more recently Rust. Looking forward to getting 
accepted into collage, hopefully, next year.

- 🇧🇷 Based in Brazil
- 🧠 I really enjoy problem solving
- 🖥️ Curious about tech
- 🎵 Musician
- 🌐 I speak portuguese, english, and am also trying to learn spanish


### Goals

1. Getting accepted for a Computer science degree at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)
2. Acquiring more proficiency in Rust by building more projects
3. Taking a deeper look at Python and Javascript, along with their associated use cases
4. Learning C and low level programming for a more solid understanding of computing in general
5. Networking with developers that have similar interests
6. Crafting a better, and more professional, github profile
7. Coming up with more goals
